# HackerBay University Program 🏫 🔥
This repository contains all my output for the HackerBay University Program. 
<hr>

It's a work in progress 🚧👷 that would get updated as I move on with the program. To have a look at what I learn during this program, feel free to peep this repository. Cheers!!! 

### Task 1 🐌
Wrote simple APIs to demonstrate my understanding on how APIs work. Was tasked to write simple GET and POST APIs that performed a certain function.

### Task 2 🚀
Worked with Postgres database and connected with created APIs, saved and queried data from database and authenticated using passport and JWT.
